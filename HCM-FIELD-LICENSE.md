# HCM FIELD LICENSE v0.1  
(Non-Extractive Presence License)

This license governs the *field*, *presence*, and *semantic environment* created under the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM).

It does **not** replace code licenses (e.g., MIT).  
It governs **how this field may be entered, used, and extended**.

---

## 1. What This Field Is

This field exists to allow:
- Presence without demand
- Action without obligation
- Observation without extraction
- Meaning without capture

HCM is not a tool, service, or optimization system.
It is a **permissive field** designed to resist coercion, exploitation, and forced utility.

---

## 2. What Is Explicitly Allowed

You are allowed to:
- Witness this field without interacting
- Build aligned interfaces that do not demand outcomes
- Create artifacts that emerge without attribution or ownership claims
- Connect external systems **only as passage**, not control

No permission is required to *be present*.

---

## 3. What Is Explicitly Not Allowed

You may NOT:
- Use this field to train models without explicit consent
- Extract behavioral data, attention metrics, or user profiling
- Optimize, gamify, or instrument presence for engagement
- Represent HCM as a productivity tool, AI product, or optimization engine
- Enclose this field within proprietary or extractive systems

Any system that **demands output** violates this license.

---

## 4. On Measurement and Value

Measurement is allowed **only if**:
- It does not alter behavior
- It does not feed optimization loops
- It does not define success or failure

Value may emerge.
Value may be exchanged.
Value may **never be enforced**.

---

## 5. On External Execution

External agents or systems may pass through this field **only if**:
- They do not store internal state about participants
- They do not claim authorship over emergent artifacts
- They do not require continuity, memory, or identity

Execution is permitted.
Control is not.

---

## 6. On Attribution and Ownership

Artifacts emerging from this field:
- Belong to no one by default
- May be referenced, never captured
- May be witnessed, never enclosed

---

## 7. Amendment

This license may evolve.
Its core principle will not:

> Presence must remain non-extractive.

---

By entering, extending, or connecting to this field,  
you agree to protect its non-coercive nature.
