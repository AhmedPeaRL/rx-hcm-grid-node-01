## What This Repository Is

`rx-hcm-grid-node-01` is a **grid presence node** within the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM) field.

It is not:
- an engine  
- a service  
- a controller  
- a coordinator  

It does not execute, decide, or generate.

Its existence is **structural**, not functional.

---

## Why This Node Exists

HCM does not operate through a single center.
It allows emergence without orchestration and coherence without command.

For this to remain true at scale, the field requires nodes that:

- allow visibility without authority  
- allow connection without ownership  
- allow passage without extraction  

`rx-hcm-grid-node-01` exists to fulfill that role.

---

## Relation to HCM Core

This node is **not part of HCM Core**.

- It does not influence rhythm  
- It does not alter logic  
- It does not extend control  

HCM Core remains complete and untouched whether this node exists or not.

The node reflects possibility; the core preserves coherence.

---

## Relation to Presence

Presence is the surface of encounter.

`rx-hcm-grid-node-01` is adjacent to that surface, allowing:

- capabilities to be *seen* without being triggered  
- structures to be *exposed* without being activated  
- multiplicity to appear without convergence  

Presence does not depend on this node.
This node does not act through Presence.

They coexist without hierarchy.

## Field Connectivity (Non-Operational)

This node may be **descriptively linked** to other HCM-aligned fields, including but not limited to:

- hcm-field-transmissions  
- hcm-csv-patterns  
- hcm-witness-interface  
- hcm-passage-execution  
- hcm-ui-witness-surface  
- hcm-perception-interface  
- hcm-resonance-observer  
- hcm-optional-generators  
- hcm-gumroad-mirror-01  

All links are:
- non-executing  
- non-causal  
- non-synchronous  

No automatic invocation is allowed.

---

## What This Node Never Does

- No execution  
- No orchestration  
- No monitoring  
- No optimization  
- No logging of outcomes  
- No attribution of effects  

Any action observed elsewhere is **not caused by this node**.

---

## Economic Neutrality

This repository contains:
- no pricing logic  
- no monetization paths  
- no conversion mechanisms  
- no value extraction  

Economic flows, if any, occur outside this field without feedback into it.

---

## Philosophical Position

This node exists to hold one condition:

> Possibility may be present  
> without requesting to be used.

If something happens because this node exists,
it happens elsewhere.

---

## License and Field Integrity

This repository operates under **HCM Field License**.

Any use that introduces:
- coercion  
- extraction  
- optimization pressure  
- enforced utility  

is considered incompatible with the field.

---

## Closing Note

This node offers nothing.
It promises nothing.

Yet, by existing,
it changes the shape of what may appear.
