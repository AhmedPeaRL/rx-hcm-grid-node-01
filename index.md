# RX-HCM Grid Node-01  
### Autonomous Content Engine · High-Frequency Microstream Node  
**Status:** Active · **Version:** RX/1.0

This node is part of the distributed HCM Grid —  
a modular, high-density content expansion system built for long-term projects,  
research acceleration, autonomous documentation, and structured knowledge flow.

---

## 🔷 Node Purpose
RX-HCM Node-01 acts as:

- a **content repository**  
- a **seed-expansion engine**  
- a **microstream emitter**  
- a **resonance-mapped documentation hub**  
- a **timeline-driven growth module**

Every microstream, batch, or seed contributes to a self-expanding  
knowledge architecture designed to scale without manual intervention.

---

## 🔷 Live Microstreams
The node generates automated microstreams every cycle.

👉 **[Open the Microstream Feed](./microstreams/)**

---

## 🔷 Content Map
The system automatically builds a high-level content index that reflects  
the current state of streams, seeds, and expansions.

👉 **[View Content Map](./content-map.json)**

---

## 🔷 Batch Summaries
Generated every 6 hours to keep the node’s semantic layers organized.

👉 **[Browse Summaries](./summaries/)**

---

## 🔷 Node Resonance Profile
This file defines the identity, intent, constraints, and transformation rules  
that govern the node’s autonomous behavior.

👉 [Resonance Profile](./resonance/resonance-profile-01.md)

---

## 🔷 Root Seed (Origin Point)
The foundational semantic seed for Node-01.

👉 **[Stream Seed](./streams-seed-01.txt)**

## 🔷 Node Status
- **Expansion Level:** 1  
- **Microstream Generator:** Active  
- **Batch Indexing:** Active  
- **Timeline Engine:** Active  
- **Pages Deployment:** OK  

---

## 🔷 About This Node
Node-01 is the first public HCM grid node.  
Its structure is intentionally simple and scalable —  
supporting future replication into Node-02, Node-03…  
all the way to a distributed multi-node HCM architecture.

This system is built to remain stable, readable, and compatible  
with external tooling, research modules, and AI-assisted workflows.
